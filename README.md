# ICAT Documentation

This repository is for anyone coming to the ICAT spaces. It hosts a wide variety of documentation, patches, and programs for use at ICAT to make your life easier. It can be cloned to your local computer for later use.

If there are changes that need to be made, feel free to make a pull request and we can make the appropriate changes.

# Rules for Pushing to the Repository

1. Avoid using spaces in file names. This will make working with git much harder. Use hyphens instead: This-is-a-file.txt, instead of "This is a file.txt"

2. When making commits, make sure to include enough information so we know what changed from the previous version. Be specific! This will make our lives easier when it comes to documenting our documentation.

3. Pictures for documentation should go in the .imagegit folder for use within the repository.

# Credits

Include names and/or email addresses here if people feel comfortable doing that.
